# Azure Deployment Systematic Resolution Plan

## Current Issue Analysis
Two consecutive Azure deployment failures despite:
- Correct Next.js configuration 
- Valid GitHub secrets
- Proper environment variables
- Optimized build configurations

## Root Cause Investigation Required
The deployment failures suggest a fundamental compatibility issue between:
1. Next.js 15.3.2 App Router structure
2. Azure Static Web Apps build environment
3. Complex application architecture (143 API routes)

## Systematic Resolution Approach

### Phase 1: Minimal Working Deployment
Create stripped-down version to establish successful Azure pipeline:
- Single page Next.js app
- One API route for testing
- Verify Azure Functions conversion works

### Phase 2: Incremental API Addition
Once baseline works:
- Add core API routes (5-10 endpoints)
- Test Azure Functions generation
- Verify database connectivity

### Phase 3: Full Application Deployment
- Deploy complete Rishi Platform
- All 143 API routes
- Full functionality testing

## Implementation Plan
1. Create minimal test application
2. Deploy to verify Azure pipeline works
3. Incrementally add complexity
4. Identify exact failure point
5. Implement targeted fixes

This systematic approach will isolate the root cause and ensure successful deployment of the complete Rishi Platform.
