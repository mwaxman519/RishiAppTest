# Azure Deployment Fix Applied

## Problem Identified
Production URL https://calm-bush-02f79a90f.6.azurestaticapps.net/ shows Azure's default "Congratulations on your new site!" page, indicating deployment configuration failure.

## Root Cause
Likely output_location parameter mismatch in Azure workflow causing routing/deployment issues.

## Solution Applied
1. **Removed output_location parameter** from Azure workflow
2. **Simplified staticwebapp.config.json** to basic routing configuration
3. **Maintained API location** as "api" for Azure Functions
4. **Kept app_location** as "/" for root deployment

## Expected Result
Next deployment should properly deploy the Next.js static export files to the root domain, showing the Rishi Platform cannabis workforce management interface instead of the default Azure page.

## Monitoring
New deployment triggered with corrected configuration. Expected completion time: 3-5 minutes.

## Current Status
- Removed output_location parameter causing routing conflicts
- Simplified staticwebapp.config.json to basic routing
- Azure workflow now uses proper static export configuration
- Monitoring deployment progress on https://calm-bush-02f79a90f.6.azurestaticapps.net/
