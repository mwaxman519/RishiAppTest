# Deployment Monitoring Results

## Configuration Changes
- Removed Turbopack experimental features
- Simplified Next.js config to production-stable settings
- Standard webpack build process restored
- All experimental flags eliminated

## Expected Timeline
- Build phase: 1-2 minutes
- Upload/distribution: 2-3 minutes  
- Total deployment: 3-5 minutes maximum

## Issue Identified and Fixed
Previous deployment failed due to missing /api directory. Azure workflow specified api_location: "api" but no API directory existed, causing deployment failure.

## Solution Implemented
Added api/health.js Azure Function to satisfy API location requirement. This provides:
- Working Azure Functions endpoint
- Proper API directory structure
- Health check functionality for monitoring

## Current Status
Deployment running with complete configuration:
- Next.js static export working
- API directory present with health endpoint
- Standard webpack build (no experimental features)
- All Azure requirements satisfied
