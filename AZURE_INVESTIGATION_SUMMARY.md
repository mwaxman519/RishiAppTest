# Azure Functions Investigation Summary

## Investigation Complete

After comprehensive testing with multiple configuration approaches, the Azure Functions deployment consistently fails with:

### Symptoms
- GitHub Actions workflows fail at "Build And Deploy" step
- API endpoints return "Backend call failure" with 500 status
- Static site deploys successfully but Functions do not activate
- Multiple workflow configurations all exhibit same failure pattern

### Configurations Tested

1. **Complex Application**: Full Next.js 15.2.2 with dependencies
2. **Simplified Dependencies**: Minimal package.json with @azure/functions
3. **Zero Dependencies**: Empty package.json with basic scripts
4. **Static HTML**: Pre-built output with skip_app_build
5. **Minimal Workflow**: Single-step deployment process

### Results
All approaches result in identical failure pattern, indicating service-level issue rather than configuration problem.

## Working Components

**Static Site**: https://polite-mud-027da750f.2.azurestaticapps.net
- Professional cannabis workforce management interface
- Responsive design with proper branding
- Global CDN distribution via Azure Static Web Apps

## Conclusion

The static site deployment demonstrates Azure Static Web Apps infrastructure is functional. The Functions deployment failure across all configuration approaches suggests either:

1. Service-specific issue with Azure Functions integration
2. Account/subscription configuration requirements
3. Regional service availability limitations

## Recommendation

For immediate deployment needs:
- Static site provides professional frontend interface
- Consider alternative serverless platforms for API functions
- Azure Functions may require service-specific configuration or support resolution

Repository maintains all configurations for future deployment attempts.
