# Azure Deployment Status - June 27, 2025

## Current Status
- **Azure App**: https://salmon-wave-08ea45710.2.azurestaticapps.net
- **Repository**: https://github.com/mwaxman519/RishiAppTest
- **Token**: Hardcoded and authenticated successfully
- **Build Status**: Failing during deployment process
- **Site Status**: Shows Azure default placeholder

## Work Completed
✅ Cleaned up conflicting workflows (removed 3 old workflows)
✅ Fixed GitHub Actions token syntax errors
✅ Updated workflow with hardcoded Azure token for testing
✅ Confirmed token authentication is working (no invalid token errors)
✅ Updated Azure Static Web Apps configuration for Next.js compatibility

## Root Issue Identified
The Azure deployment authenticates successfully but fails during the build process. The site shows Azure's default placeholder page instead of the Rishi Platform, indicating the build/deployment pipeline needs further investigation.

## Configuration Files Updated
- `.github/workflows/azure-static-web-apps-salmon-wave-08ea45710.yml`
- `staticwebapp.config.json`

The deployment is correctly targeting https://salmon-wave-08ea45710.2.azurestaticapps.net with proper token authentication.
