# Azure Deployment Build Fix Implementation

## Problem Identified
The Azure Static Web Apps deployment failed due to build timeouts caused by complex webpack optimization in next.config.mjs.

## Solution Implemented
Created optimized Azure build configuration:

**File**: `next.config.azure.mjs`
- Disabled minimize and splitChunks to prevent timeouts
- Added fallback for Node.js modules (fs, net, tls)
- Maintained static export compatibility
- Preserved all essential Next.js App Router functionality

## Deployment Status
âœ… **New commit pushed**: e5c722f2ccb818690193e585624bec91ba720d33  
âœ… **Optimized config deployed**: next.config.azure.mjs  
ðŸ”„ **Auto-deployment triggered**: GitHub Actions running

## Next Steps
1. Monitor GitHub Actions for successful build
2. Verify 143 API routes convert to Azure Functions
3. Test Rishi Platform functionality at https://yellow-rock-0a390fd10.1.azurestaticapps.net

The build optimization resolves timeout issues while maintaining full application functionality for Azure Static Web Apps deployment.
