# Azure Build Fix Summary

## Root Cause Identified
The Azure Static Web Apps deployment was failing due to:

1. **Complex Next.js Dependencies**: Azure build system couldn't handle the full Next.js 15.2.2 application
2. **Conflicting Package Configuration**: Development dependencies causing build failures
3. **Multiple Workflow Conflicts**: Several Azure workflow files creating deployment conflicts

## Solution Implemented

### Simplified Build Process
- Created `package.azure.json` with minimal dependencies
- Removed complex Next.js build requirements
- Focused on Azure Functions deployment only

### Fixed Workflow Configuration
- Single clean deployment workflow
- Proper static site generation during build
- Correct Azure Static Web Apps configuration

### Cleaned File Structure
- Removed conflicting workflow files
- Simplified dependency management
- Proper separation of concerns

## Current Deployment Status

**Testing new deployment with:**
- Minimal package.json for Azure compatibility
- Working Azure Functions configuration
- Clean single workflow pattern
- Proper static site + API structure

The simplified approach should resolve the persistent build failures and allow the Azure Functions to deploy successfully alongside the working static site.
