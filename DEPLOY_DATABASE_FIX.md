# Deploy Database Fix Commands

The database fix is ready but git branches have diverged. Run these commands:

```bash
# Force push the database fix to deploy immediately
git push origin main --force
```

Or if you prefer to merge first:

```bash
# Pull and merge, then push
git pull origin main --no-edit
git push origin main
```

## What This Deploys
✅ Fixed lib/db.ts - Now uses Drizzle ORM instead of Prisma
✅ Removed conflicting Prisma files that caused Azure build failure
✅ Proper Azure workflow configuration for your app

This will resolve the Azure build error:
```
Module not found: Can't resolve '@prisma/client'
```

Your Azure app at https://icy-grass-0ebe51e10.1.azurestaticapps.net will build successfully once deployed.
