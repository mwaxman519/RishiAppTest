# Azure Build Trigger Commands

The Azure deployment fix is ready but needs to be pushed to GitHub to trigger the build.

## Current Status
- Commit `a2ffa1c` contains the multi-platform detection fix
- Local repository is 1 commit ahead of origin/main
- Git push is timing out from Replit environment

## Manual Trigger Commands

Run these commands from your local machine or GitHub Codespaces:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/mwaxman519/RishiAppTest.git
cd RishiAppTest

# Push the fix to trigger Azure build
git push origin main

# Or force push if needed
git push origin main --force-with-lease
```

## Alternative: GitHub Web Interface

1. Go to https://github.com/mwaxman519/RishiAppTest
2. Click "Actions" tab to see workflow status
3. If no recent builds, create an empty commit:
   - Click "Create new file" 
   - Name: `trigger-build.txt`
   - Content: `Azure build trigger - $(date)`
   - Commit directly to main branch

## Expected Result

Once pushed, Azure will:
1. Detect only Node.js 18.20.4 (no Python/PHP)
2. Build successfully without multi-platform errors
3. Deploy all 143 API routes as Azure Functions
4. Update https://yellow-rock-0a390fd10.1.azurestaticapps.net

## Fix Details

The commit contains:
- Removed `encrypt-secret.py`, `pyproject.toml`, `uv.lock`
- Enhanced `oryx.ini` with platform disabling
- Strengthened GitHub workflow cleanup
- Platform detection prevention configuration
