# Azure Deployment Timeout Analysis

## Issue Pattern
- Build phase: ✅ Completes in 38-55 seconds
- Upload phase: ❌ Consistently times out at 590+ seconds
- Pattern consistent across multiple deployment attempts

## Timeline Analysis
- Build completion: ~1 minute
- Expected total deployment: 2-5 minutes  
- Actual timeout: 9+ minutes during upload polling

## Root Cause
Azure Static Web Apps service is experiencing upload/distribution pipeline issues. This is NOT a configuration problem - builds succeed but Azure's backend service fails during deployment polling.

## Immediate Workaround
- Removed Turbopack experimental features
- Simplified Next.js configuration to minimal settings
- Standard webpack build instead of experimental Turbopack

## Expected Result
Deployment should complete in 2-3 minutes with standard build process and no experimental features that might cause Azure service conflicts.
