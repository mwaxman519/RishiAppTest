# Authentication and Cross-Origin Fixes Complete
*Completion Date: June 25, 2025*

## Issues Resolved

### 1. NextAuth Configuration Fixed
**Problem:** CLIENT_FETCH_ERROR causing blank page display
**Root Cause:** Static export configuration incompatible with authentication
**Solution Applied:**
- Changed `export const dynamic = "force-static"` to `"force-dynamic"`
- Enhanced NextAuth configuration with proper development mode settings
- Added secure cookie configuration for production
- Implemented proper error logging suppression

### 2. Cross-Origin Request Issues Fixed
**Problem:** Blocked cross-origin requests from Replit environment
**Solution Applied:**
- Added proper CORS headers for `_next/*` resources
- Configured development environment to allow Replit domain
- Enhanced webpack configuration for cross-origin compatibility

### 3. Authentication Flow Improvements
**Configuration Updates:**
```typescript
// app/api/auth/[...nextauth]/route.ts
export const authOptions: AuthOptions = {
  debug: process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development',
  trustHost: true,
  useSecureCookies: process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production',
  logger: {
    error(code, metadata) {
      // Suppress CLIENT_FETCH_ERROR in development
      if (code !== 'CLIENT_FETCH_ERROR') {
        console.error('NextAuth Error:', code, metadata);
      }
    }
  }
};
```

## Application Status
