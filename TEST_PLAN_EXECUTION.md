# Test Plan Execution - Azure Deployment Issue

## Test 1: Service Health Verification

### Actions Required:
1. Check Azure Portal → Service Health for Static Web Apps issues
2. Check Azure Portal → Your Static Web App → Deployment History for patterns
3. Try manual deployment through Azure Portal interface

### How to Execute:
- Go to Azure Portal → Static Web Apps → RishiPlatform
- Click "Deployment history" - check if other deployments show similar timeouts
- Try "Deploy" → "GitHub" → manually trigger deployment
- Check "Activity Log" for any error details

### Expected Results:
- Service health shows active issues: Confirms Azure service problem
- Manual deployment also fails: Confirms service issue
- Manual deployment succeeds: Indicates GitHub Actions workflow problem

## Test 2: Fresh Environment Test

### Actions Required:
1. Create new Azure Static Web App resource in different region
2. Use same GitHub repository with new deployment token
3. Test deployment with minimal configuration

### How to Execute:
- Azure Portal → Create Resource → Static Web App
- Choose different region (e.g., West US 2 if currently East US)
- Connect to same GitHub repository
- Use minimal HTML configuration (current diagnostic test)

### Expected Results:
- New resource deploys successfully: Original resource corrupted
- New resource also fails: Account/subscription level issue
- Different region works: Regional service limitation

## Test 3: Azure CLI Direct Deployment

### Actions Required:
1. Use Azure CLI to deploy static files directly
2. Bypass GitHub Actions completely
3. Upload built artifacts manually

### How to Execute:
```bash
# Install Azure CLI and login
az login
az staticwebapp create --name RishiPlatformTest --source https://github.com/mwaxman519/rishiplatform
```

### Expected Results:
- CLI deployment succeeds: GitHub Actions integration issue
- CLI deployment fails: Core Azure Static Web Apps service problem

## Implementation Priority:
Execute tests in order - stop when root cause identified
