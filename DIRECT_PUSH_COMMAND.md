# Direct Push Command from Replit

I've prepared the git repository with all Azure fix files. Here's the command to push directly to your repository:

```bash
# Navigate to the prepared repository
cd azure-fix-files

# Push with your GitHub credentials (you'll be prompted for username/token)
git push https://github.com/mwaxman519/rishi-platform.git main

# Alternative: Push with token authentication
git push https://your_username:your_github_token@github.com/mwaxman519/rishi-platform.git main
```

## What's ready to push:
- `next.config.azure-production.mjs` (the missing Azure config file)
- `scripts/` directory with build optimization scripts
- `shared/schema.ts` with required exports

## Get your GitHub token:
1. Go to: https://github.com/settings/tokens
2. Generate new token (classic) with "repo" permissions
3. Use it in the command above

This will immediately trigger Azure deployment and fix the build failure.
