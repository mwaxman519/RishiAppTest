# Azure Deployment Root Cause Analysis and Action Plan

## Pattern Analysis
Multiple deployment attempts with consistent timeout failures at upload phase:
- Framework detection issues: RESOLVED
- Next.js export command deprecation: RESOLVED  
- Dependency conflicts: RESOLVED
- Configuration complexity: RESOLVED

## Current Situation
Even the minimal configuration (Next.js 14.2.0 + single Azure Function) is failing, indicating deeper infrastructure issues.

## Root Cause Hypothesis
1. **Azure Static Web Apps Service Issues**: Possible regional service degradation
2. **Account/Subscription Limits**: Resource quotas or billing issues
3. **Repository Size**: Accumulated deployment artifacts causing bloat
4. **Token Permissions**: AZURE_STATIC_WEB_APPS_API_TOKEN insufficient privileges

## Definitive Action Plan

### Phase 1: Infrastructure Verification
- Check Azure Portal for service health alerts
- Verify subscription status and quotas
- Validate deployment token permissions
- Review Azure Static Web Apps resource limits

### Phase 2: Clean Repository Strategy  
- Create fresh repository with minimal codebase
- Test basic HTML deployment first
- Incrementally add Next.js components
- Verify each deployment step individually

### Phase 3: Alternative Deployment Methods
- Try manual deployment through Azure Portal
- Test with different Azure regions
- Consider Azure App Service as fallback

## Recommendation
Given the consistent timeout pattern across multiple configurations, this appears to be an Azure service or account-level issue rather than code configuration problem.
