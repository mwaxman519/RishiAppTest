# Azure Static Web Apps Production Checklist - Cannabis Booking Platform

## ✅ COMPLETE: Azure Static Web Apps Configuration

### 1. Static Web App Configuration ✅
- **staticwebapp.config.json**: Properly configured with security headers, health check routes, and API timeout settings
- **Health Check Routes**: `/api/health` endpoint accessible without authentication for Azure Application Gateway monitoring
- **Security Headers**: HSTS, XSS protection, content security, and frame options configured
- **API Runtime**: Node.js 18 with 5-minute timeout for cannabis booking operations
- **Memory Allocation**: 256MB per function instance optimized for event processing

### 2. Production API Routes ✅
- **Circuit Breaker Protection**: All critical cannabis operations protected from cascading failures
- **Rate Limiting**: Cannabis-specific limits (50 booking requests/minute, 100 general API requests/minute)
- **Error Handling**: Sanitized error responses with request tracking for production debugging
- **Event-Driven Architecture**: EventBusService with timeout handling and graceful shutdown
- **UUID-Based Tracking**: All entities and requests use proper UUID identification

### 3. Cannabis Industry Features ✅
- **8-Stage Booking Lifecycle**: Complete event publishing for booking management
- **Staff Assignment System**: Real-time staff scheduling with GPS check-in tracking  
- **Equipment Management**: Kit template assignment and return verification
- **Multi-Organization Support**: Client-specific event isolation and operational workflows
- **Regional Operations**: State-specific filtering and cannabis-legal jurisdiction management

### 4. Health Monitoring ✅
- **System Health Endpoint**: `/api/health` provides comprehensive status for Azure monitoring
- **Database Health**: Connection monitoring and query performance tracking
- **Memory Monitoring**: Heap usage alerts and automatic cleanup processes
- **Cannabis Service Health**: Booking, staff, equipment, and location service monitoring
- **Circuit Breaker Status**: Real-time service resilience monitoring

### 5. Security & Performance ✅
- **CORS Configuration**: Properly configured for cannabis industry domain restrictions
- **Request Logging**: UUID-based request tracking for audit trails and debugging
- **Production Error Handling**: Sanitized error messages without internal details exposure
- **Memory Leak Prevention**: Event store cleanup and circuit breaker maintenance
- **Graceful Shutdown**: Proper signal handling for Azure Function lifecycle

## Azure Static Web Apps Deployment Configuration

### Build Settings
```yaml
app_location: "/"
api_location: "app/api"
output_location: "out"
app_build_command: "npm run build"
api_build_command: "npm run build:api"
```

### Environment Variables (Configure in Azure Portal)
```env
DATABASE_URL=<neon-postgresql-connection-string>
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=<production-secret>
NEXTAUTH_URL=<your-production-domain>
ALLOWED_ORIGINS=<your-production-domains>
NODE_ENV=production
```

### Azure Application Gateway Health Probe
```yaml
health_check:
  path: /api/health
  protocol: HTTPS
  port: 443
  interval: 30
  timeout: 20
  unhealthy_threshold: 3
  healthy_threshold: 2
```

### Function App Configuration
```json
{
  "version": "2.0",
  "functionTimeout": "00:05:00",
  "maxConcurrentRequests": 100,
  "maxOutstandingRequests": 200,
  "extensions": {
    "http": {
      "routePrefix": "api"
    }
  }
}
```

## Performance Optimizations for Azure

### 1. Cold Start Mitigation ✅
- **EventBusService Singleton**: Shared instance across function invocations
- **Connection Pooling**: Database connections reused across requests
- **Memory Management**: Optimized event store size and cleanup processes
- **Circuit Breaker Caching**: Service status cached to reduce initialization overhead

### 2. Cannabis Operations Scaling ✅
- **Booking Operations**: Optimized for hundreds of monthly bookings per client
- **Staff Coordination**: High-volume rate limits for real-time staff management
- **Event Processing**: Async event publishing without blocking API responses
- **Regional Filtering**: Efficient state-based cannabis operational queries

### 3. Azure-Specific Optimizations ✅
- **Function Timeout**: 5-minute limit for complex cannabis workflow processing
- **Memory Allocation**: 256MB optimized for event-driven architecture overhead
- **Static Asset Caching**: Optimized cache headers for Azure CDN distribution
- **API Response Compression**: Reduced bandwidth for cannabis operational data

## Cannabis Industry Compliance Notes ✅
- **No Regulatory Dependencies**: System operates as pure operational workflow platform
- **Audit Trail Compliance**: Complete event history for all operational activities
- **Multi-State Operations**: Regional filtering supports cannabis-legal jurisdictions
- **Client Data Isolation**: Organization-specific data boundaries and access controls

## Deployment Readiness Status: ✅ READY FOR PRODUCTION

### Azure Static Web Apps Features Utilized:
- ✅ Automatic HTTPS with custom domain support
- ✅ Global CDN distribution for static assets
- ✅ Serverless API functions with proper scaling
- ✅ Built-in authentication integration ready
