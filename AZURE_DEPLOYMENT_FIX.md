# Azure Deployment Fix - Prisma to Drizzle Database Resolution

## Issue Resolved
Azure Static Web Apps build was failing with:
```
Module not found: Can't resolve '@prisma/client'
Import trace for requested module: ./app/api/locations/route.ts
```

## Root Cause
The Rishi Platform uses Drizzle ORM but had leftover Prisma configuration files causing import conflicts during Azure build process.

## Fixes Applied
1. **Updated lib/db.ts** - Changed from Prisma to proper Drizzle ORM configuration:
   ```typescript
   import { drizzle } from 'drizzle-orm/neon-http';
   import { neon } from '@neondatabase/serverless';
   import * as schema from '@/shared/schema';
   
   const sql = neon(process.env.DATABASE_URL!);
   export const db = drizzle(sql, { schema });
   ```

2. **Removed conflicting Prisma files**:
   - `prisma-integration.js`
   - `prisma-integration.mjs` 
   - `prisma-generate.js`
   - `lib/prisma.ts`
   - `app/lib/prisma.ts`

## Next Steps - Run These Commands
```bash
git pull origin main
git add .
git commit -m "Fix Azure build: Remove all Prisma dependencies, use Drizzle ORM"
git push origin main
```

## Expected Result
Azure Static Web Apps at https://icy-grass-0ebe51e10.1.azurestaticapps.net should build successfully with the proper Drizzle database configuration and Neon PostgreSQL connection.

## Verification
Once deployed, the API endpoints should work correctly with the Neon database connection using Drizzle ORM instead of attempting to load the non-existent Prisma client.
