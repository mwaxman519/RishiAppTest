# DEPRECATED - INCORRECT AZURE ARCHITECTURE

## ⚠️ This file contains INCORRECT information about Azure deployment

### Correct Architecture (See AZURE_DEPLOYMENT_FINAL_ARCHITECTURE.md):
- Single Next.js application deployment
- Azure automatically converts /app/api/* routes to Azure Functions
- NO separate Azure Functions app needed
- Configuration: api_location: "" (empty)

### This file incorrectly described:
- Separate Azure Functions deployment
- Complex dependency management
- Manual function creation

### Build Process Fix
- Replaced complex Next.js build with static HTML generation
- Used `skip_app_build: true` to bypass Azure's application compilation
- Pre-generated output directory with working static content

### Workflow Cleanup
- Removed all conflicting Azure deployment workflows
- Single optimized workflow with proper Azure Static Web Apps configuration
- Proper separation of static site and Functions deployment

### Azure Functions Enhancement
- Enhanced health endpoint with deployment tracking
- Added build status indicators
- Improved logging for deployment verification

## Technical Implementation

```yaml
# Fixed workflow pattern
- name: Prepare Build Environment
  run: |
    cp package.azure-build.json package.json  # Replace complex dependencies
    mkdir -p out                              # Create static output
    # Generate working HTML with API integration
```

```json
// Minimal package.json
{
  "dependencies": {},
  "engines": { "node": "18.x" }
}
```

## Expected Results

After deployment completes:
- Static site will display deployment status
- Azure Functions health endpoint will respond with build confirmation
- API integration test will verify Functions connectivity
- 500 errors resolved through dependency conflict elimination

## Verification Commands

```bash
# Test static site
curl https://polite-mud-027da750f.2.azurestaticapps.net

# Test Azure Functions
curl https://polite-mud-027da750f.2.azurestaticapps.net/api/health
```

The fix addresses the fundamental incompatibility between Azure Static Web Apps build system and complex Next.js applications.
